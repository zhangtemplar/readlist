# Academic Torrents

[Academic Torrents](http://academictorrents.com/) makes 15.49TB of research data available.

We've designed a distributed system for sharing enormous datasets - for researchers, by researchers. The result is a scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant repository for data, with blazing fast download speeds.

# SpaceNet
SpaceNet is a corpus of commercial satellite imagery and labeled training data being made available at no cost to the public to foster innovation in the development of computer vision algorithms to automatically extract information from remote sensing data. The website is [https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/spacenet/]

The current SpaceNet corpus includes approximately 1,900 square kilometers full-resolution 50 cm imagery collected from DigitalGlobeâ€™s WorldView-2 commercial satellite and includes 8-band multispectral data. The dataset also includes 220,594 building footprints derived from this imagery which can be used as training data for machine learning. This dataset is being made public to advance the development of algorithms to automatically extract geometric features such as roads, building footprints, and points of interest using satellite imagery. The first Area of Interest (AOI) to be released is of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.
