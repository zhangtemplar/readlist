# Text to Image
Tensorflow implementation of text to image synthesis using thought vectors is available at [https://github.com/paarthneekhara/text-to-image]

This is an experimental tensorflow implementation of synthesizing images from captions using [Skip Thought Vectors][1]. The images are synthesized using the GAN-CLS Algorithm from the paper [Generative Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis][2]. This implementation is built on top of the excellent [DCGAN in Tensorflow][3]. The following is the model architecture. The blue bars represent the Skip Thought Vectors for the captions.

# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
Tensorflow implementation of [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) which is a stabilize Generative Adversarial Networks. The referenced torch code can be found [here](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch). The tensorflow implementation is availalbe at [https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow]

* [Brandon Amos](http://bamos.github.io/) wrote an excellent [blog post](http://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/) and [image completion code](https://github.com/bamos/dcgan-completion.tensorflow) based on this repo.
* *To avoid the fast convergence of D (discriminator) network, G (generatior) network is updatesd twice for each D network update which is a different from original paper.*
